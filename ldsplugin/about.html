    <h1><strong><span>QGIS LDS Plugin</span></strong></h1>
        <p>The QGIS LDS Plugin couples QGIS an
        d&nbsp;the <a href="https://data.linz.govt.nz/data/">LINZ Data Services (LDS)</a>&nbsp;
        to provide simple importing of LINZ data.&nbsp;</p>
    <h2><span><strong>Selecting a Service&nbsp;</strong></span></h2>
        <p>The QGIS LDS Plugin supports LDS data served over WFS, WMS, WMTS protocols.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Please see the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.linz.govt.nz/data/linz-data-service/guides-and-documentation/which-web-service-should-i-use">online resource</a>&nbsp;
        available on the LINZ website for more on these protocols&nbsp;</p>
    <h2><span><strong>API Key&nbsp;</strong></span></h2>
        <p>Prior to using the plugin your LDS API Key must be stored via the "Setting menu"</p>
        <p>For more on LDS API keys please see the 
        LDS&nbsp;<a href="http://www.linz.govt.nz/data/linz-data-service/guides-and-documentation/creating-an-api-key">resources</a>.</p>
    <h2><strong>Coordinate Reference System</strong></h2>
        <p>When selecting and importing LDS datasets via the&nbsp;QGIS LDS Plugin the projects 
        current Coordinate Reference System (CRS) will be used. QGIS will enable 
        on-the-fly (OTF) Reprojection and the dataset being imported will be reprojected
        on the fly to the QGIS projects CRS.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This however is not the case with WMTS. As it is not idea to reproject WMTS 
        and all LDS WMTS services are served in WGS 84 Web Mercator (EPSG:3857), the 
        QGIS LDS Plugin will force the QGIS projects CRS to&nbsp;WGS 84 Web Mercator (EPSG:3857). 
        The user is notified by QGIS's message bar when the CRS change is made.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As many datasets are being reprojected to be combined into the one map canvas 
        the user of this plugin should be aware of issues arising from projecting spatial datasets.&nbsp;</p>
    <h2><span><strong>Requests, Responses and&nbsp;Patience</strong></span></h2>
        <p>When opening the plugin for the first time, the QGIS interface will be temporarily 
        inactive while awaiting the LDS server's response. However after the initial request LDS dataset 
        information is stored locally and all subsequent requests for the current QGIS session will see the 
        dataset information populated immediately.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>At times the LDS server is experiencing high load the plugin may fail to 
        populate the table with the available dataset information. In this case the user will 
        need to close the plugin interface and re-open it.&nbsp;</p>
    <h2><span><strong>Filtering</strong></span></h2>
        <p>The left hand panel allows users to filter by service types 
        (either, All, WFS, WMS, WMTS). All column headers can be toggled to allow ascending
        or descending ordering of their data.</p>
        <p>Text can be entered in The "Filter Data Sets" search bar to filter the datasets 
        on key words.&nbsp;</p>
