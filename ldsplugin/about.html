    <h1><strong><span>QGIS LDS Plugin</span></strong></h1>
        <p>The QGIS LDS Plugin couples QGIS and 
        the <a href="https://data.linz.govt.nz/data/">LINZ Data Services (LDS)</a>&nbsp;
        to provide simple importing of LINZ data.&nbsp;</p>
    <h2><span><strong>Selecting a Service&nbsp;</strong></span></h2>
        <p>The QGIS LDS Plugin supports LDS data served over WFS, WMS and WMTS protocols.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Please see the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.linz.govt.nz/data/linz-data-service/guides-and-documentation/which-web-service-should-i-use">online resource</a>&nbsp;
        available on the LINZ website for more on these protocols.&nbsp;</p>
    <h2><span><strong>API Key&nbsp;</strong></span></h2>
        <p>Prior to using the plugin your LDS API Key must be stored via the "Settings menu"</p>
        <p>When saving your API key this will trigger the plugin to request all LDS dataset 
        information from the LDS server. This may take sometime - please see the below
        "Requests, Responses and Patience"</p>
        <p>For more on LDS API keys please see the 
        LDS&nbsp;<a href="http://www.linz.govt.nz/data/linz-data-service/guides-and-documentation/creating-an-api-key">resources</a>.</p>
    <h2><strong>Coordinate Reference System</strong></h2>
        <p>As an initial release, when selecting and importing LDS datasets via the QGIS LDS Plugin.
        the plugin will force the QGIS projects CRS to WGS 84 Web Mercator (EPSG:3857). 
        The user is then notified by QGIS's message bar when the CRS change is made.</p>

        <p>Currently WGS 84 Web Mercator (EPSG:3857) is used by default as all LDS WMTS services
        are served in this projection and it is not always a good idea to reproject WMTS. 
        This is the initial release of the plugin and there are plans to improve the handling of CRS
        with subsequent releases.</p>
    <h2><span><strong>Requests, Responses and&nbsp;Patience</strong></span></h2>
        <p>When opening the plugin for the first time, the QGIS interface will be temporarily 
        inactive while awaiting the LDS server's response (again this is an intial release
        and there are plans to improve this also). However, after the initial request LDS 
        dataset information is stored in memory and all subsequent requests for the current QGIS 
        session will see the dataset information populated immediately.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If your internet connection is slow or at times the LDS server is experiencing high load 
        the plugin may fail to populate the table with the available dataset information. 
        In this case the user will need to close the plugin interface and re-open it.

        <p>For those experiencing on going slowness when the plugin loads, the settings tab has
        the ability to disable services. If services that are not required are disabled the plugin 
        will load faster. For the settings to take affect the plugin must be reloaded (there is 
        however no need for the setting to take affect until the next session as when viewing the 
        "settings" tab the data should already have been loaded. 
        &nbsp;</p>
    <h2><span><strong>Filtering</strong></span></h2>
        <p>The left hand panel allows users to filter by service types 
        (either, All, WFS, WMS, WMTS).</p> 
        <p>All column headers can be toggled to allow ascending
        or descending ordering of their data.</p>
        <p>Text can be entered in the "Filter Data Sets" search bar to filter the datasets 
        by keyword.&nbsp;</p>
