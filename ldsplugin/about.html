<h1><strong>LDS Plugin</strong> - beta</h1>
<p>The LDS Plugin couples QGIS and the <a href="https://data.linz.govt.nz/data/">LINZ 
Data Services (LDS)</a>&nbsp; (and others - see changing scope) to provide simple 
importing of LINZ data.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Changing Scope</h2>
<p>The initial scope of this plugin was to just couple the LDS and QGIS. However 
as other New Zealand agencies also make use of the same technology the settings 
interface also allows these other agencies open data web portals to be configured.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At time of release this plugin supports the coupling of the below open data portals with QGIS:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://data.linz.govt.nz/">data.linz.govt.nz</a>&nbsp;(Toitū Te Whenua - Land Information New Zealand)</li>
<li><a href="https://data.mfe.govt.nz/">data.mfe.govt.nz</a>&nbsp;(Manatū Mō Te Taiao - Ministry for the Environment)</li>
<li><a href="https://datafinder.stats.govt.nz/">datafinder.stats.govt.nz</a>&nbsp;(Tatauranga Aotearoa - Statistics New Zealand)</li>
<li><a href="https://lris.scinfo.org.nz/">lris.scinfo.org.nz</a>&nbsp;(Manaaki Whenua - Landcare Research)</li>
<li><a href="https://geodata.nzdf.mil.nz/">https://geodata.nzdf.mil.nz</a>&nbsp;(Te Ope Kātua o Aotearoa - New Zealand Defence Force</li>
</ul>
<p>Future releases will look to broaden the scope of the plugin further 
to include all WFS, WMS, WMTS OGC web services served from any domain.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Selecting a Service&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>The LDS Plugin supports data served over WFS, WMS and WMTS protocols.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please see the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.linz.govt.nz/data/linz-data-service/guides-
and-documentation/which-web-service-should-i-use">online resource</a>&nbsp; available 
on the LINZ website for more on these protocols.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>API Keys&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>Prior to using the plugin the services API Key must be stored via the "Settings menu"</p>
<p>When saving your API key this will trigger the plugin to request all of the services 
dataset information. This may take sometime.</p>
<p>For more on API keys please see the 
LDS&nbsp;<a href="http://www.linz.govt.nz/data/linz-data-service/
guides-and-documentation/creating-an-api-key">resources</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Coordinate Reference System</strong></h2>
<p>As an initial release, when importing datasets via the LDS Plugin. the plugin 
will force the QGIS projects CRS to WGS 84 Web Mercator (EPSG:3857). The user is 
 notified by QGIS's message bar when the CRS change is made.</p>
<p>Currently WGS 84 Web Mercator (EPSG:3857) is used by default as all the data providers
 WMTS services are served in this projection and problems arise when 
reprojecting WMTS. This is the initial release of the plugin and there are plans
to improve the handling of CRS with subsequent releases (See the GitHub issues for more).</p>
<h2><strong>Requests, Responses, Patience and Caching</strong></h2>
<p>When saving a Domain and API key for the first time via the Setting menu the 
plugin will request the capabilities documents for each service type (WMS, WMTS, WFS). 
When these documents are large this can cause the plugin to appear inactive. 
The good news is this is the only interaction with the plug where substantial patience
may be required. Once the initial documents are fetched, they will be cached and 
will be updated in the background each time the plugin is started.</p>
<h2><strong>Filtering</strong></h2>
<p>The left hand panel allows users to filter by service types (either, All, WFS, WMS, WMTS).</p>
<p>All column headers can be toggled to allow ascending or descending ordering of their data.</p>
<p>Text can be entered in the "Filter Data Sets" search bar to filter the datasets by keyword.&nbsp;</p>
